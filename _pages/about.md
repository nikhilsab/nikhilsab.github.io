Iâ€™m a first year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Virginia Tech advised by [Dr. Chandan Reddy](https://people.cs.vt.edu/reddy/). My current research primarily centers on delving into the realm of Natural Language Processing, with a particular emphasis on its diverse applications, including tabular data analysis and symbolic regression.

My academic journey traces back to my Bachelor's in Electronics Engineering from VJTI, Mumbai. My undergraduate thesis dedicated to the exploration of Deepfake Detection, led me to join Virginia Tech for the Masters program. During my Master's program, I collaborated on projects on machine learning privacy with my advisor [Dr. Ruoxi Jia](https://ruoxijia.info/). 

Research Interests
=====
My research interests are in artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on Generative AI, Large Language Models, and Natural Language Processing. I aim to advance the capabilities and comprehension of these technologies. I have an experience of working on:
* Enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models on complex tasks like code generation, tabular reasoning and equation discovery
* Implementing data-centric techniques to protect data and improve the machine learning model performance of downstream tasks
